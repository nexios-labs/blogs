Meet **Nexios**, a revolutionary utility-first Python web framework that's changing how developers build modern web applications. Unlike traditional frameworks that force you into rigid patterns, Nexios provides a comprehensive toolkit that adapts to your needs.

## What Makes Nexios Different?

Nexios isn't just another web framework—it's a **utility-first** approach to web development. This means you get:

- **Modular Architecture**: Mix and match components as needed
- **Rich CLI Tooling**: Project scaffolding, code generation, and development tools
- **Extensible Plugin System**: Build and share custom functionality
- **Community-Driven**: Active ecosystem with `nexios-contrib` package

## Quick Start Example

Getting started with Nexios is incredibly simple:

```python
from nexios import NexiosApp
from nexios.http import Request, Response

# Create app with built-in utilities
app = NexiosApp(title="My Utility API")

@app.get("/")
async def basic(request: Request, response: Response):
    return {"message": "Hello from Nexios utilities!"}

@app.get("/users/{user_id:int}")
async def get_user(request: Request, response: Response):
    user_id = request.path_params.user_id
    return {
        "user_id": user_id,
        "name": f"User {user_id}",
        "email": f"user{user_id}@example.com"
    }

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```
