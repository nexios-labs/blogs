![Nexios Bootstrap Architecture](./nexios-bootstrap-architecture.png)

When starting a new web project, the last thing you want is to spend hours configuring boilerplate code, setting up databases, and configuring middleware. That's where **Nexios Bootstrap** comes in—a meticulously crafted starter template that gets you from zero to production-ready application in minutes.

## What Makes Nexios Bootstrap Exceptional?

Nexios Bootstrap isn't just another template; it's a **production-grade foundation** built with modern development best practices. Here's why developers choose it:

### **ASGI-Powered Performance**
Built on Nexios's ASGI architecture, this template delivers lightning-fast async performance right out of the box. No more waiting for synchronous bottlenecks—your applications handle concurrent requests with ease.

### **Smart Dependency Injection**
Say goodbye to messy global state and tight coupling. The built-in DI system promotes clean, testable code that scales beautifully as your application grows.

### **Auto-Generated Documentation**
Every API endpoint you create automatically generates interactive OpenAPI/Swagger documentation. Your team will always have up-to-date API docs without any extra effort.

## Included Features Out of the Box

### **Project Structure That Makes Sense**
```

├── Dockerfile                 # Production container
└── Makefile                   # Build automation
```

### **Security Built-In**
- JWT authentication ready
- CORS and CSRF protection
- Secure headers middleware
- API key authentication options

### **Database Integration**
- PostgreSQL support with connection pooling
- SQLite for development
- Database migrations included
- Environment-based configuration

## Quick Start: From Zero to Running Application

### Step 1: Clone and Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nexios-labs/nexios-bootstrap.git
cd nexios-bootstrap
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Configure Your Database
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit your database settings
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/myapp
```

### Step 3: Run Your Application
```bash
make dev
```

That's it! Your application is now running at `http://localhost:8080` with:
- Health check endpoints
- Interactive API docs at `/docs`
- Request/response logging
- CORS configured
- Database connections ready

## Ready-to-Use API Endpoints

The template comes with practical examples that demonstrate best practices:

### Health Check System
```python
# GET /health/ - Basic health check
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "nexios-starter",
  "timestamp": "2024-02-20T12:00:00Z",
  "version": "0.1.0"
}

# POST /health/ - Advanced health check with async processing
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "my-service",
  "check_type": "basic",
  "counting_result": {
    "numbers": [1, 3, 5, 7, 9],
    "total_count": 5
  },
  "details": {
    "database": "connected",
    "cache": "available"
  }
}
```

## Docker-Ready Deployment

Deploying to production is seamless with the included Docker configuration:

```bash
# Development environment
docker-compose up -d

# Production environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

The Dockerfile is optimized for:
- Multi-stage builds for smaller images
- Fast startup times
- Security best practices
- Health checks included

## Testing That Actually Works

No more excuses for not writing tests! The template includes:

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test suites
pytest tests/test_api.py -v

# Watch mode for development
pytest tests/ --watch
```

### Example Test Structure
```python
async def test_health_endpoint():
    """Test the basic health check endpoint"""
    async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://test") as ac:
        response = await ac.get("/health/")
        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert response.json()["status"] == "ok"
```

## Developer Experience Features

### **Code Quality Tools**
- **Ruff** for lightning-fast linting and formatting
- **Pre-commit hooks** for consistent code
- **Type checking** with mypy integration

### **Development Automation**
```bash
# Format all code
ruff format src/ tests/

# Lint and fix issues
ruff check src/ tests/ --fix

# Run full quality check
make quality
```

### **Environment Management**
- `.env.example` template
- Development vs production configs
- Environment-specific middleware
